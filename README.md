## 🚀 **Running the Project Locally**

**Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine:**

---

📁 1. Clone the repository
Open your terminal and run the following command (replace the URL with your project's repo URL):

<pre> <code>git clone https://github.com/powercoder-hackers/swiss-hack-front.git
cd project-name</code> </pre>

📥 2. Install dependencies
Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed. Then, install all required packages:

<pre> <code>npm install</code> </pre>

This installs all dependencies listed in package.json (e.g., React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, React Router DOM, TypeScript, etc.).

🧪 3. Run the development server
Start the app in development mode using Vite:

<pre> <code>npm run dev</code> </pre>


🏗️ 4. Build for production
Create an optimized production build:

<pre> <code>npm run build</code> </pre>
The final files will be generated in the dist/ folder. This is what you'd deploy to a production server.

🔍 5. Preview the production build locally
To simulate the production environment locally:

<pre> <code>npm run preview</code> </pre>
